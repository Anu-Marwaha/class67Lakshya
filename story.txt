Lion and Mouse Story in English
A lion was resting in its cave in a dense forest. Just then a rat passed by and he was happy to see the lion. He walked over the sleeping lion and started jumping. The rat began to enjoy a lot of it but in a while the lion woke up. The lion pressed the rat into its claw and angrily looked at the rat. The lion was still thinking of killing the rat when the rat started to giggle.

The Rat said, “Forgive me, Maharaj, I did not know that your sleep would be disturbed. Please forgive me this time it will never happen again. ” Hearing this, the lion looked at the rat and freed him. As soon as he got free, the rat said, “Thank you, Maharaj, today you have given me life, I will always remember you all this and if you have time and you need my help, I will definitely help you.”

Hearing this, the lion started smiling and thought that what could such a small creature help me? And let the mouse go.

Shortly thereafter, predators laid a trap in the forest in which the lion was trapped. He was roaring hard to save his life. Hearing the roar of the lion, the rat came to the lion. The rat noticed that the lion got trapped badly in the net. He cut the lion’s rope of net with his sharp teeths and the lion became free.

Now the lion regrets his earlier thinking of how small he thought the rat was. But the same rat saved his life today. The lion returned to his cave, thanking the rat.

Moral of the Story: Every one is equal and have their own importance. Never underestimate the power of a small person.
